        Shampoo is typically used to remove the unwanted build-up of sebum (natural oils) in the hair without stripping out so much as to make hair unmanageable.<BR> Shampoo is generally made by combining a surfactant, most often sodium lauryl sulfate or sodium laureth sulfate, with a co-surfactant, most often cocamidopropyl betaine in water.<BR> The sulfate ingredient acts as a surfactant, trapping oils and other contaminants, similarly to soap.<BR>
